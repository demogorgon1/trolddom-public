		"You see, my brother has managed to get himself kidnapped by rebels up north. Last week he went on a business trip to Valoris, but outside the city he got assaulted by a bunch of hooligans. At least that's what"
		"I've been told. Allegedly they sold him to the rebels who took him somewhere inside the occupied part of Valoris. Now they want us to pay a large amount for them to release him? That's ridiculous!\n\n"
		"I need you to venture into occupied Valoris, locate my brother Jim and get him out of there. I'll make it worth your while."
