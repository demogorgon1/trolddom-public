		"Yesterday I was out prospecting in the caves south of here and I got ambushed by a spider larger than anything I've seen before! It was quite horrible and I had to leg it. It had fangs the size of broad swords!\n\n"
		"You seem like a real go-getter, maybe you can find it and kill it so I can continue my prospecting? I'm not sure exactly what cave it happened in, but it's south east and not far from here."
