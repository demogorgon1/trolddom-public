		"They seem to be starving - doesn't even want to go near the water. The only place I saw anything in the water was inside Skaldrun, to the west. Something was stirring, not sure what it was.\n\n"
		"That place is seriously creepy, though. Not setting my foot in there again, that's for sure! I think I'll just go home... But I'm a bit curious. Maybe you can catch it, whatever it is?\n\n"
