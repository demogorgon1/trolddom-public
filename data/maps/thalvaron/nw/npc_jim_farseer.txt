		"break through, sometimes by themselves, sometimes aided by misguided allies.\n\n"
		"You've encountered a spawn of Zyxtharion, a foul creature. Now I need you to face off with Zyxtharion itself. Defeat it. Make it crawl back where it came from.\n\n"
		"In the east, inside the Tirnwood Thicket, you'll find a place where the skin of reality is very thin. There, at the ancient temple, blow this horn to trick the beast to come forth."
