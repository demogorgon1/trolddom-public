	[
		"A hunter named Lia passed through here last week. She was coming from the north and needed a place to stay for a bit while preparing to go further south east towards Faerandor. I tried to convince her"
		"that it's too dangerous these days, but she insisted on leaving. Can I convince you to see if you can find her and see if she's fine? I prepared a bag of supplies that I'd like for you to bring to her if possible.\n\n"
		"I don't know where exactly she is now, but if you leave the town east and then follow the road south you might run into her."
